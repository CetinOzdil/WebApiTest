## Introduction
This is a testbed project for me to understand ASP.NET Core concepts and test new ideas quickly.

## Tested concepts
* For generalising webhosting a customised `IWebHostBuilder` class
* A hybrid JWT+Cookie supported authorization 
* Option to add allowed paths for both path and endpoints (maybe automatic detection in future) 
* SignalR Hub integration and authorization (both hub & method level)
* Simple web pages for testing features
